-- TAZC_Lipread -- gappy fragment rendering for a Deaf receiver reading lips
-- off a spoken-language speaker they can see (R-A9, RULED BY EMILY).
--
-- Real lipreading is genuinely lossy: only ~30-40% of speech is visually
-- distinguishable on the lips, the rest is context and guesswork. This
-- module is the "the rest is guesswork" half -- a pure text transform,
-- given whatever text the receiver's own normal comprehension render
-- already produced (client/TAZC_Anonymity.deafReception decides WHETHER to
-- call this at all; see its header for the full ladder). Deterministic per
-- (text, seed), like every other seeded render in this mod -- the same
-- utterance reads the same gaps every time, not a fresh roll per glance.
--
-- Never full comprehension, never improvable to full -- there is no state
-- here that climbs toward clarity. That is the real-life truth, and it
-- keeps signing (full-bandwidth) the reason to actually learn ASL rather
-- than lean on lipreading as a free bypass.
--
-- SCOPE NOTE: v1 legibility is a uniform per-word roll, not frequency-
-- weighted against a palette's zipf table as the spec's "existing zipf/
-- rank tooling" phrase suggests. The caller passes in whatever text the
-- receiver's own comprehension render already produced -- which, for a
-- non-comprehending receiver, is already babble carrying no reliable word-
-- frequency signal of its own. See the build report for the full reasoning.

-- M7 fix: a character counts as "word-like" if it's ASCII and matches %w,
-- or is non-ASCII at all (Cyrillic, accented Latin, CJK, emoji, ...) --
-- the old byte-oriented text:find("%w+") pattern only ever matched single
-- ASCII bytes, so a multi-byte character sitting right after an ASCII run
-- (e.g. "caf" + "\195\169" in "café") split OFF the ASCII prefix as one
-- "word" and left the multi-byte tail as a separate "other" token that was
-- never eligible for gapping and got glued back on verbatim next to a
-- GAP_MARKER -- readable-looking but semantically corrupted output, and
-- for a fully non-ASCII word (Cyrillic, etc.) the whole word silently
-- skipped the legibility roll entirely (always "legible" -- breaks the
-- never-full guarantee for non-Latin-script speech). Iterating by
-- TAZC_StringUtils.utf8chars -- this codebase's own VM-portable codepoint
-- walker (Lua 5.4 byte strings vs Kahlua's Java-composed codepoint
-- strings) -- means a multi-byte character is never split mid-sequence,
-- on either VM.
--
-- Byte-VALUE check, not #ch: under Lua 5.4, ch:byte(1) for a genuine ASCII
-- character is <128 and for a UTF-8 lead byte is >=0xC0; under Kahlua,
-- EVERY character (ASCII or composed) is a 1-length string (#ch == 1
-- always), but ch:byte(1) still returns the true codepoint value, so
-- >=128 correctly identifies "non-ASCII" on both storage models -- #ch
-- alone can't (it's always 1 under Kahlua regardless of codepoint).

-- lets the never-full guarantee below see the WHOLE roll before deciding
-- anything is final.

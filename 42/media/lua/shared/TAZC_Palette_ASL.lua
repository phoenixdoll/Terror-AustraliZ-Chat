-- TAZC_Babble palette: ASL (American Sign Language)
-- Signed modality (R-A1) -- not a spoken palette in a costume. No onset/
-- nucleus/coda/functionWord pools: there is no phonetic surface to babble.
-- The babble-equivalent pool is `gestures` (gesture-prose fragments, seeded
-- for stability the same way TAZC_Babble seeds its own picks); comprehension
-- is unlocked concept-by-concept via `lex`, exactly like every spoken
-- palette's dictionary-bleed layer.
--
-- GLOSS CONVENTION: `lex[CONCEPT_ID] = { l2 = lowercase(CONCEPT_ID) }`.
-- Glossing a sign as its nearest English word in capitals (WATER, GATE,
-- DANGER, ...) IS the real, standard ASL transcription convention, and
-- TAZC_Concepts' IDs already are that word -- the UPPERCASE display happens
-- at render time (server/TAZC_Lang.lua's signed reinforcement), not in the
-- stored form. Every acquisition/teaching/zipf lookup in this codebase
-- (TAZC_Acquisition token keys, TAZC_Resolve.reverseLex, TAZC_Teaching's
-- dictionary compare) keys off palette.lex forms VERBATIM with no internal
-- case-folding -- every spoken palette's forms happen to already be
-- lowercase, so this has never surfaced before. Storing ASL's forms
-- lowercase too keeps that implicit contract intact instead of splitting
-- "water" (spoken-style lowercase keys elsewhere) from "WATER" (a
-- differently-cased key) into two unrelated acquisition records.
-- Programmatic generation (rather than a hand-typed table) means every
-- concept TAZC_Concepts knows about gets a citation-form gloss with zero
-- transcription risk. IDs carrying a disambiguation suffix (CLEAN_ADJ,
-- split IDs, etc.) are skipped -- the suffix isn't a real gloss token;
-- TAZC_Resolve's parent walk still reaches the base concept's gloss for those.
--
-- No zipf: v1 has no sourced ASL sign-frequency corpus (the spoken palettes'
-- zipf tables come from a linguist-reviewed forms.tsv this palette has no
-- equivalent of). Optional field; comprehension falls back to the unranked
-- prior, same as any spoken token outside its palette's zipf list.

-- m2: a small, hand-curated override for the worst mechanical glosses --
-- concept IDs whose own concept-tree ID reads as an awkward abstract-noun
-- or archaic form next to the natural word a fluent signer would actually
-- choose (data/concepts.tsv's own `en` aliases, not the ID, carry the
-- natural word). Deliberately tiny: mechanical ID-as-gloss generation
-- stays the base for the other ~500+ concepts; this only touches the
-- handful worth hand-fixing.
--   KIN        -> FAMILY   (KIN's own alias is "family,relative" --
--                            "kin" is archaic/uncommon next to "family")
--   SADNESS    -> SAD      (abstract noun vs. the plain adjective form)
--   LONELINESS -> LONELY   (same abstract-noun-vs-adjective mismatch)

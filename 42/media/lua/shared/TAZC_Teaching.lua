    Terror AustraliZ Chat - Teaching Engine (v8.7)

    The third axis of fluency: Acquisition (v8.5) is passive exposure,
    Heritage (v8.6) is inherited cultural content, Teaching is active
    pedagogy -- a speaker directly telling a listener what a word means.

    DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

    Teaching is a discrete moment: a speaker who has acquired a word can
    teach it to a listener who has heard it at least once before, and the
    teaching event produces INSTANT acquisition -- the click moment IS the
    teaching beat, not a delayed consolidation.

    The system stays silent on the learner's side -- no whisper announces
    it; the render transition (babbled -> "Water (eau)" bracket) carries the
    moment, and the listener experiences their own comprehension as personal
    discovery. v8.16.1 "Voices" gives the TEACHER one quiet cue when the
    lesson lands ("They seem to follow."), completing the two-player scene
    without touching the learner's half. Delivery lives server-side in
    TAZC_Lang (deduped per utterance); this module remains pure detection.

    v8.16.2 widened the detection surface: quotes/stray punctuation around
    captured words are tolerated; diacritics fold to plain ASCII on both
    sides of the dictionary compare (PZ chat on an EN keyboard can't type
    "ba\197\159", so "bas" can teach it); multiword forms are claimable by
    their first word; two more template families joined ("this/that/it is
    called Y", "we call X Y"). The claimed L2 normalizes to the canonical
    lex spelling before reaching acquisition, so teaching keys the same
    form the render pipeline records exposure under.

    DETECTION SURFACE

    Both natives and learners invoke teaching by typing one of the templated
    meta-language forms (palette or defaults below):
        "Water is called eau in French"    "Eau means water"
        "We say eau for water"             "The word for water is eau"
        "Eau is the word for water"        "We call water eau"
        "This is called eau"  (dictionary supplies the concept)

    Patterns require an L1 and L2 word (except the this/that/it family,
    L2-only); the L2 must exist in the palette dictionary and the L1 must be
    its canonical mapping -- false teaching ("Water is called horse") is
    rejected at detection.

    GATES (applied in TAZC_Lang.renderWithLangs around the detection call)

    Speaker-eligibility: the speaker must OWN the word. Natives pass
    trivially; learners pass iff they've both acquired AND produced the L2
    (used it in their own speech) -- you can't teach a word you've only just
    heard.

    Receiver-heard (applied per-receiver in renderForReceiver): the receiver
    must have heard the L2 at least once before. Teaching crystallises
    recognition of an already-encountered word; it doesn't install one from
    scratch -- matching how "What does X mean?" implies prior encounter.

    Together the two gates force the optimal-strategy and immersive-play
    paths into the same shape: a determined pair can still teach through the
    dictionary, but only after the native USES the word in proximity speech
    first (passive exposure) and then explains it -- the grind path looks
    like real tutoring because it IS real tutoring under these constraints.

    PER-MESSAGE LIMIT

    One teaching event per utterance; leftmost valid match wins (prevents
    spam-teach chains). Authoring rule: every pattern needs a structural
    marker (called, means, word for, etc.) -- never bare "X is Y", which
    would catch ordinary speech.

    EXTENSIBILITY

    Default patterns live on this module; palettes can override via a
    `teaching` block (reserved schema slot) for language communities with
    their own standard teaching idioms.

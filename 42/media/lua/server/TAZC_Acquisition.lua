    Terror AustraliZ Chat - Acquisition Module (v8.16.2)

    Per-username x per-source-language x per-token exposure tables, plus the
    pure comprehension formula mapping exposure into the partial-clarity render
    decision. Spine of the language-learning system: TAZC_Lang's dictionary
    substitution layer reads from here on every render.

    WHAT THIS OWNS: the acquisition table (in-memory, TAZC_Persist A/B slots);
    the pure comprehension formula (Zipfian prior + exposure sigmoid, cap);
    acquisition-threshold detection; LRU eviction at a per-language token cap;
    periodic dirty-flag flush (no fsync per utterance).

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT OWN: dictionary substitution (TAZC_Lang's render path
    calls recordExposureBatch with the heard L2 tokens); the AUTHORITATIVE
    teaching detection and instant-grant gate -- template matching (translation
    pairs, TPR) lives in TAZC_Teaching.lua, dispatch/delivery in TAZC_Lang.lua;
    this module only supplies recordTeaching as the write target once that
    gate fires. It DOES own teachingContextBoosts (TEACHING DETECTION,
    below): a soft, one-shot salience heuristic -- repetition (>=2x in one
    message) and co-occurrence with an already-acquired token -- that nudges
    ordinary exposure weight, no gate, no instant grant; easy to conflate
    with the authoritative path above but structurally distinct from it;
    /lex and /comp wire-up (TAZC_Lang dispatches those).

    DESIGN INVARIANTS (do not violate)
      1. Pure read-side API: queries are O(1) hash lookups, never mutate.
      2. Comprehension formula is a pure function on (count, contextBoost,
         zipfRank): reproducible, testable, swappable.
      3. Engine independence: imports TAZC_Core, TAZC_Persist, and TAZC_LangRegistry
         (plus lazy, call-site requires of TAZC_Concepts/TAZC_Resolve for the
         connection-bonus lookups, below); reads palette.lex/palette.family
         as read-only data via TAZC_LangRegistry.getPalette. Never imports
         TAZC_Babble (the phonetic engine) or anything that itself calls
         sendServerCommand/reads SandboxVars (invariant 3a) -- the boundary
         is "no engine coupling, no side-effect coupling," not "no palette
         data."
      3a. Engine purity (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md): never reads Events,
          sendServerCommand, or SandboxVars, and never registers against
          Events. Every side effect is injected -- setExposureTraceSink /
          setLapseNoticeSink for outbound notifications, setProfile / setSpeed
          for server-pinned tuning, and onServerStarted / onEveryOneMinute
          (LIFECYCLE EVENTS, below) as named functions the composition root
          (TAZC_Server.lua) registers on its own Events. This module supplies
          behavior; it never decides when that behavior runs.
      4. Procedural-babble tokens are NEVER tracked -- only lex tokens
         (resolving to a concept the speaker's palette lexicalizes) enter the
         exposure table, bounding per-user table size.
      5. contextBoost is multiplicative, capped at 2.0, so stacked teaching
         boosts (applyContextBoost) can't run away.

    PUBLIC API -- ~51 functions, grouped by the file's section banners (full
    signatures/behavior live in each section's own comments):
      Recording: recordExposureBatch(username, sourceLang, tokenEntries,
        contextBoostMap, addressed, speakerUsername) -> tokensCrossed, meta --
        the passive-exposure write path (see its own doc comment); plus
        applyContextBoost / teachingContextBoosts, the one-shot / persistent
        boost primitives the teaching layer plugs into.
      Production tracking (v8.7-v8.9): recordProduction,
        recordProductionAttempt, hasProduced, productiveProb,
        productiveProbForRecord, effectiveProduced.
      Teaching (v8.7 instant-grant): recordTeaching(username, sourceLang,
        token, rank, teacherUsername) -> bool.
      Queries (read-only): getExposure, getAllTokens, getMisacquisition,
        acquiredCountForPalette, acquiredCountForCore, estimateComprehension,
        hasAcquiredAny, languagesWithData, teachingImpact.
      Pure formula/classifier: comprehensionProb, isAcquiredByFormula,
        tokenState, effectiveTokenCap.
      Reset (/forget + admin): forgetLanguage, forgetUser, inventoryForUser.
      Connection (v8.9 cross-language/cross-token bonuses):
        familyClosenessPrior/ForLang, accentTintPrior/ForLang, familyBonus,
        lexicalSetBonus, dynamicContextBoost. (The count-driven pure formulas
        behind these -- familyBonusFromCount, lexicalSetBonusFromCount,
        voicesBonusFromCount, saturationFactor -- and the per-exposure
        weighting helpers -- registerWeightForToken, addressednessWeight,
        voicesCountOf -- are module-internal locals, not public API.)
      Server-injected configuration (invariant 3a): setProfile/activeProfile,
        setSpeed, setExposureTraceSink, setLapseNoticeSink -- TAZC_Server.lua
        and TAZC_Lang.lua are the only legitimate callers.
      Lifecycle hooks (exported, not self-registered; invariant 3a):
        onServerStarted, onEveryOneMinute.
      Form migrations (v8.16.1 token-key renames): applyFormMigrations.
      Test/diagnostic surface: setTestTime, clearTestTime, flushNow,
        applyDecayToRecord (offline harness), plus read-only tuning-constant
        getters (acquisitionThreshold, graceDaysReceptive,
        decayPerDayReceptive, decayChargeCapDays, voicesTrackCap,
        secondsPerDay) that /lex, /comp, and the offline suite read directly.

--
-- Production lags reception: substitution in applyProductionPass rolls
-- against a probability derived from `produced` count (mirroring the
-- receptive formula, slower trajectory) rather than a binary `acquired` check.
--
-- DESIGN INTENT: real fluency has production trailing reception, sometimes by
-- a lot -- a learner who understands "eau" when heard may blank saying it.
-- Modeled as ambient experience: the speaker types English, the engine rolls
-- per-word against the productive probability, and on failure the L1 passes
-- through as plain text -- the listener hears the wrong word said. Success
-- increments `produced`, raising future probability; failures don't decrement
-- (decay is v8.9). Same immersion-interface lineage as v8.7: no notification
-- fires: the plain L1 IS the blank, felt in what came out.
--
-- ROLL-PER-WORD: one roll per unique L2 token per utterance, deterministic on
-- (speaker, message, timestamp, l2Lower) -- repeats of the same word in one
-- message share the result. Roll cache lives in TAZC_Lang's applyProductionPass;
-- recordProduction fires once per word per message (caller-managed).

-- DECAY (v8.9 -- "Drift") -- the fourth side of the fluency model. v8.5-v8.8
-- added gain (passive exposure, teaching, practice); v8.9 adds loss: words
-- unused long enough drift below threshold and are forgotten. Receptive and
-- productive decay independently, productive faster -- the canonical
-- asymmetry where you can still recognise a word you can no longer say.
--
-- LAZY EVALUATION: no timer, no periodic sweep. Every public read/write that
-- touches a record applies pending decay first via applyDecayToRecord --
-- stored values become correct at the moment consulted, invisibly stale
-- between. Keeps the engine pure-functional in time: decay is always
-- computable from (lastHeard/lastProduced, count/produced, now); tests pass
-- an explicit `now`, production passes os.time().
--
-- GRACE + DAILY DECAY (two-phase): no decay within the grace period after the
-- last event; after grace, count/produced drops a fixed amount per day. A
-- decaying word stays `acquired` but its render degrades smoothly with the
-- falling count (see tokenState). Only at count 0 is it fully forgotten:
-- `acquired` flips false and one quiet lapse notice fires (LAPSE NOTICE,
-- below). Teaching-acquired words decay exactly like passive-acquired ones --
-- the remedy is the same either way: hear it, use it, practice it.
--
-- ABSENCE DISCOUNT (v8.16.2): decay is charged lazily per gap since last
-- consulted, capped at DECAY_CHARGE_CAP_DAYS days past grace however long the
-- silence really was -- a break costs a little rust, never the language (the
-- locked rule: never deny a player a word they've earned).
--
-- LAST-HEARD CONSUMPTION: after decay applies, lastHeard advances to
-- `now - GRACE_SECONDS`, so the next check measures elapsed-past-grace from
-- there -- continuous-decay semantics equivalent to one polled-at-30 query
-- regardless of how many polls land during a 30-day idle window.
--
-- SPACING (RETRIEVAL-STRENGTHENING): a word re-heard after cooling past grace
-- is an effortful, spaced retrieval that builds durability -- recordExposureBatch
-- increments `stability` on each one (capped at STABILITY_MAX; massed
-- re-hearings within grace build nothing). Stability divides the daily decay
-- rate (rate = DECAY_PER_DAY_* / (1 + stability)) and persists through
-- forgetting, so a lapsed-but-once-spaced word relearns faster and sticks
-- harder (the savings effect). No stability field decays exactly as 0 --
-- existing saves stay safe.

-- reinforcement, modeling two felt-experience claims:
--   1. Romance-language speakers pick up another Romance language faster
--      than a Slavic one -- family closeness matters. Pre-v8.9 each palette
--      was an island; Connection adds an intra-family context boost scaling
--      with how much the learner already knows in same-family languages.
--   2. Words cluster into semantic neighborhoods -- hearing "eau" primes
--      "nourriture", "danger". Palettes declared `lexicalSets` from the
--      start, reserved-but-unconsumed; v8.9 wires them up. Acquiring set
--      members boosts acquisition of the others, saturating with coverage
--      (once you know most of a neighborhood, the next member gets only
--      modest additional help).
--
-- TRANSIENT, NOT STORED: both boosts compute dynamically at the moment of
-- acquisition/production evaluation and are never stored on the record --
-- family/set knowledge helps THIS exposure without permanently inflating it;
-- stored `contextBoost` keeps meaning "one-shot boosts from teaching events"
